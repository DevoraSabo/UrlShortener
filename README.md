# UrlShortener

Don't we all know those crazy, unintelligible URLs that you know you're going to need later, but there is absolutely no way you're going to remember all that gibberish for when you're going to need it?

Those insanely long URLs that users cannot remember on their own - no way, Jose! - are now shortened into handy little links dynamically. Users can log in and see all the URLs theyâ€™ve shortened over time, or they can quickly shorten a URL anonymously and save it on their desktop. 

This application utilizes authorization by BCrypt to ease use for our users while keeping your URL history private and NuGet's ShortId library to generate a random URL that is guarranteed to be unreplicated.

Technologies Utilized:

- ASP.NET MVC
- Entity Framework Core
- AJAX
